# Simple Git Website Project

This project demonstrates Git version control on a simple website with three HTML pages:
- index.html (Home Page)
- about.html (About Page)
- contact.html (Contact Page)

A `.gitignore` file is used to exclude temporary files, and the repository is managed using commits and GitHub.
